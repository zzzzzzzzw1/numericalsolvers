# Lorenz System Numerical Solvers (MATLAB)

## Overview
Implementation of three numerical ODE solvers, Euler, RK4, and the implicit fourth-order Runge–Kutta method and applies them to the Lorenz system.  
The goal is to compare solver behaviour, stability, and accuracy when modelling chaotic dynamics.

## Solvers Implemented
- **Euler Method** (`EulerSolver.m`)
- **Classical Runge–Kutta 4** (`RK4Solver.m`)
- **Implicit RK4 (Gauss–Legendre)** (`IRK4Solver.m`)
- **Lorenz system definition** (`lorenz.m`)

## How to Run
Open MATLAB and run:

```matlab
main
```
